# maproulette-la-county-pools
Use L.A. County Assessor data to jump to a parcel with a pool and ask for it to be traced. https://data.lacounty.gov/Parcel-/Assessor-Parcels-Data-2015/hvzm-fn38 

We've started doing a few of these as test in between building uploads. Likely none of this will be "official" until the MapRoulette project moves out of beta.
